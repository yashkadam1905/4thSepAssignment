            Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
            layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the
            layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography
            and images.
            <br />
            Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
            appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
            software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.

            Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This
            involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
            pages and make them interactive.
            <br />
            Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and
            back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or
            application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
